<!-- Basic CSS:

Learn about basic pseudo-selectors (:after, :hover, etc.).
Learn about z-index.
Make sure you know the Box Model inside and out, and learn about collapsible margins.
Learn when to use Float and when NOT to use Float.
Bookmark W3Schools and MDN.
Advanced CSS:

Learn about new relational units (viewport units).
Learn about advanced pseudo-selectors (:nth-child, etc).
Learn about using style guides (BEM, OOCSS, and my favorite- SMACSS).
Learn about CSS preprocessors. Most developers use SASS, though you can also explore LESS and Stylus as well.
Explore other CSS3 features such as gradients, transitions, filters, etc.
Learn about Flexbox. This knowledge is must-have, in my opinion.
Learn about Media Queries. The W3C continues to work on this specification, so be sure to keep up with the changes.
Learn about additional tools, such as stylestats, which can help you manage your CSS as your repo scales.
Cutting Edge CSS:

Bookmark World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and learn about the phases of specification maturation.
Learn about "CSS4"
Learn about new experimental features (at this time, a couple good ones would be native variables and display: grid;).
Participate and give technical feedback on W3C recommendations and drafts. -->
